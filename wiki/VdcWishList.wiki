= Altered Priority List (28/04/2012):= 
 # Disable enveloping mod of torpeodoes vs planets. i.e. it shouldn't multiply damage by 4 if torpedo got this mod installed. Explanation - how a torpedo can envelop the whole planet?!!!
 # Find offsets for the weapons miniaturization coefficients.
 # Global FIX - Add ability to save (dump) combat data when it stalls (hangs) showing - waiting for opponent - message. Add ability to restore combat data by pressing a special key, for instance ALT+F12.
 # Add to Sensors ability to decloak the stealth field and cloaking device equipped ships;
 # Weapons allocation percentage on starbases/battlestation/star fortresses. (Heavy mount is 25%, want to increase it);   - DONE
 # Re-arrange Terafoming progressive cost for flat cost or even decreasing cost with cost multiplier=2/3 - DONE
 # Reduce number of combat rounds from 50 to 20;  - DONE
 # Disable requirement to click OK every time on raid confirmation window. Example: When you hit autobattle then when the same window pops up it stays for about 5-7 seconds, then AI removes it automatically. But when you are controlling your ships, you have to press OK or battle doesn't go futher from this point(opponent will see the screen: waiting for opponent message till it is confirmed by pressing OK button). Would be good if it was the same as in autobattle - message dissapeared automatically after a short pause, and no need for confirmation.   
 # Increase the frequency of restoration of fighters in Fighter Garrison from 10 rounds to 3(or 4) rounds.
 # Increase range for heavy mount beams by 50%. Currently it's 50 squares. Rather increase the range for ground installations and starbases.
 # Find offset for the number of tractor beams required for each type of the hulls.  
 # Find a way to seperate cost of building of Androids (50 pp)from the cost of freighters, since they use the same offset. - DONE
 # Make the Antarans attack earlier. There is almost certainly a delay that has been set to stop them attacking before approx. turn 180
 # Star bases: add torpedoes instead of the missiles, when torpedo tech becomes available.
 # Allow starbases to use all available modifications for the beams and torpedoes.
 # Add New type of planetary defense fields - Planetary Damper Field, which would be given additionally to Damper field technology (2 in 1). Planetary Damper field would reduce damage against planet by 3/4.
 # Find the Leaders offering time matrix;
 # Add Hard Shields effect to class XX shield, so that it becomes naturally immune to SP effects and transporters; 
 # Make multiphased shields tech an achievement: all ships shields automatically increase strength by 50% without need to have a multiphased shield special installed... 
 # Make Autorepair Unit an achievement - so that not required to put it as a special on a ship, but it works automatically, like cybernetic race.
 # Find offsets for autorepair and cybernetic restoration percentages, especially for repairment of internals. Current values are 20 (10) and 10 (5) for structure and internals for autorepair and cybernetic respectively.
 # Add Death Ray Rifle - additional rifle, which is given, when you research Death Ray beam technology (2 in 1). 
 # Raid. Raid calculations. Bugs with the raid: desynch on raiding starbase with no marines (killed by neutron blaster); Zero Marines Raid bug (game stalls in MP, when you raid with zero marines);
 # Mutation Bug (desynch issue);
 # Feudal Bug (ships costs issue);
 # AI ship designing; %распределения оружия в его дизайнах, учет новой вместимости кораблей, установить флаги на некоторые спешалсы, чтобы АИ всегда их ставил их, когда они имеются в наличии, вне зависимо от ситуации (например, augmented engines, battle scanner, reinforced hull, lightning field....);  
 # Telepathy
  * Fix telepathy skills of the leaders (now they add only half bonus they should); Increase basic bonus of the leaders telepathy skill.
 # Бонусы сканеров по уменьшению действия систем радиоэлектронного подавления ECM: tachyon scanner -20; neutronium scanner -40; sensors -70.
